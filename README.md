## My process

Firstly, i setup my project, i used sass for this project so i created a scss folder for my sass files.
Next i add basic css to my project such as body, html and assigning the color schemes in variables.
After that i start creating the basic structure for my project using the appropriate html tags while also adding css to it as well.
When everything is set, i work on the hover effects,
then i proceed to make it responsive
Then finally i added javascript to make everything come together

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time doing a card that flips over and display' something else,
so it was a great learning experience for me.

### Continued development

I would love to explore customized radio buttons more.

### Useful resources
